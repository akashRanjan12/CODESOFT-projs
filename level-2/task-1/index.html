          <p class="reveal">
            Mahatma Gandhi, born Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi on October 2, 1869,
            in Porbandar, Gujarat, was one of the most influential leaders in
            world history. He played a crucial role in India's struggle for
            independence from British rule and is remembered for his principles
            of non-violence (Ahimsa) and truth (Satyagraha). <br />Gandhi was
            born into a Hindu Gujarati family. His father, Karamchand Gandhi,
            was a chief minister in Porbandar, while his mother, Putlibai, was a
            deeply religious woman. Her influence led young Gandhi to develop
            strong moral and spiritual values. At the age of 13, Gandhi was
            married to Kasturba Gandhi in a child marriage, a common practice of
            the time. Despite this, he continued his education and later
            traveled to London in 1888 to study law at the Inner Temple. After
            completing his law studies, he returned to India but struggled to
            establish a legal career.

          <h1 class="reveal">Mahatma Gandhi’s Principles</h1>

          <p id="ct" class="reveal">
            Gandhi believed that truth is the ultimate power. He emphasized
            honesty in personal and public life. He said: "Truth alone will
            endure, all the rest will be swept away before the tide of time."
            <br />
            <br />
            Ahimsa means not causing harm in thoughts, words, or actions. Gandhi
            used peaceful protests to fight injustice, proving that wars and
            violence are not the only solutions. <br />
            <br />
            Gandhi promoted Swadeshi, meaning self-reliance. He encouraged
            Indians to use locally made goods instead of foreign products.
            <br /><br />Gandhi believed in universal upliftment, ensuring no one
            is left behind. He worked for the poor and marginalized sections of
            society. <br />
            <br />
            Satyagraha means “truth-force”—a peaceful method of fighting
            injustice. Gandhi urged people to resist oppression without
            violence. <br />
            <br />
            Gandhi lived a very simple life, wearing minimal clothes and owning
            few possessions. He believed materialism leads to greed and
            unhappiness. Gandhi <br /><br />
            respected all religions and believed in unity among different
            communities. He worked tirelessly to stop communal violence. Gandhi
            <br /><br />
            strongly advocated for cleanliness and sanitation. He led by example
            by cleaning toilets and promoting hygiene awareness.

          <h1 class="reveal">Background of Mahatma Gandhi</h1>
          <p id="ct" class="reveal">
            Gandhi's father, Karamchand Uttamchand Gandhi (1822–1885), served as
            the dewan (chief minister) of Porbandar state. His family originated
            from the then village of Kutiana in what was then Junagadh State.[6]
            Although Karamchand only had been a clerk in the state
            administration and had an elementary education, he proved a capable
            chief minister.<br /><br />
            During his tenure, Karamchand married four times. His first two
            wives died young, after each had given birth to a daughter, and his
            third marriage was childless. In 1857, Karamchand sought his third
            wife's permission to remarry; that year, he married Putlibai
            (1844–1891), who also came from Junagadh, and was from a Pranami
            Vaishnava family. Karamchand and Putlibai had four children: a son,
            Laxmidas (c. 1860–1914); a daughter, Raliatbehn (1862–1960); a
            second son, Karsandas (c. 1866–1913). and a third son, Mohandas
            Karamchand Gandhi who was born on 2 October 1869 in Porbandar (also
            known as Sudamapuri), a coastal town on the Kathiawar Peninsula and
            then part of the small princely state of Porbandar in the Kathiawar
            Agency of the British Raj. <br /><br />
            In 1874, Gandhi's father, Karamchand, left Porbandar for the smaller
            state of Rajkot, where he became a counsellor to its ruler, the
            Thakur Sahib; though Rajkot was a less prestigious state than
            Porbandar, the British regional political agency was located there,
            which gave the state's diwan a measure of security. In 1876,
            Karamchand became diwan of Rajkot and was succeeded as diwan of
            Porbandar by his brother Tulsidas. Karamchand's family then rejoined
            him in Rajkot.They moved to their family home Kaba Gandhi No Delo in
            1881.

          <h1 class="reveal">Childhood of Mahatma Gandhi</h1>
          <p class="reveal">
            As a child, Gandhi was described by his sister Raliat as "restless
            as mercury, either playing or roaming about. One of his favourite
            pastimes was twisting dogs' ears. The Indian classics, especially
            the stories of Shravana and king Harishchandra, had a great impact
            on Gandhi in his childhood. In his autobiography, Gandhi states that
            they left an indelible impression on his mind. Gandhi writes: "It
            haunted me and I must have acted Harishchandra to myself times
            without number." Gandhi's early self-identification with truth and
            love as supreme values is traceable to these epic characters.
            <br /><br />
            The family's religious background was eclectic. Mohandas was born
            into a Gujarati Hindu Modh Bania family. Gandhi's father,
            Karamchand, was Hindu and his mother Putlibai was from a Pranami
            Vaishnava Hindu family.Gandhi's father was of Modh Baniya caste in
            the varna of Vaishya. His mother came from the medieval Krishna
            bhakti-based Pranami tradition, whose religious texts include the
            Bhagavad Gita, the Bhagavata Purana, and a collection of 14 texts
            with teachings that the tradition believes to include the essence of
            the Vedas, the Quran and the Bible. Gandhi was deeply influenced by
            his mother, an extremely pious lady who "would not think of taking
            her meals without her daily prayers... she would take the hardest
            vows and keep them without flinching. To keep two or three
            consecutive fasts was nothing to her.
            <br /><br />
            At the age of nine, Gandhi entered the local school in Rajkot, near
            his home. There, he studied the rudiments of arithmetic, history,
            the Gujarati language and geography. At the age of 11, Gandhi joined
            the High School in Rajkot, Alfred High School. He was an average
            student, won some prizes, but was a shy and tongue-tied student,
            with no interest in games; Gandhi's only companions were books and
            school lessons.

          <h1 class="reveal">Marriage of Mathma Gandhi</h1>
          <p class="reveal">
            In May 1883, the 13-year-old Gandhi was married to 14-year-old
            Kasturbai Gokuldas Kapadia (her first name was usually shortened to
            "Kasturba", and affectionately to "Ba") in an arranged marriage,
            according to the custom of the region at that time. In the process,
            he lost a year at school but was later allowed to make up by
            accelerating his studies. Gandhi's wedding was a joint event, where
            his brother and cousin were also married. Recalling the day of their
            marriage, Gandhi once said, "As we didn't know much about marriage,
            for us it meant only wearing new clothes, eating sweets and playing
            with relatives." As was the prevailing tradition, the adolescent
            bride was to spend much time at her parents' house, and away from
            her husband. <br /><br />
            Writing many years later, Gandhi described with regret the lustful
            feelings he felt for his young bride: "Even at school I used to
            think of her, and the thought of nightfall and our subsequent
            meeting was ever haunting me." Gandhi later recalled feeling jealous
            and possessive of her, such as when Kasturba would visit a temple
            with her girlfriends, and being sexually lustful in his feelings for
            her. Gandhi (right) with his eldest brother Laxmidas in 1886
            <br /><br />
            In November 1887, the 18-year-old Gandhi graduated from high school
            in Ahmedabad. In January 1888, he enrolled at Samaldas College in
            Bhavnagar State, then the sole degree-granting institution of higher
            education in the region. However, Gandhi dropped out and returned to
            his family in Porbandar.
            <br /><br />
            Outside school, Gandhi's education was enriched by exposure to
            Gujarati literature, especially reformers like Narmad and
            Govardhanram Tripathi, whose works alerted the Gujaratis to their
            own faults and weaknesses such as belief in religious dogmatism.

          <h1 class="reveal">Struggle for Indian independence (1915–1947)</h1>
          <p id="ct" class="reveal">
            At the request of Gopal Krishna Gokhale, conveyed to Gandhi by C. F.
            Andrews, Gandhi returned to India in 1915. He brought an
            international reputation as a leading Indian nationalist, theorist
            and community organiser. <br /><br />
            Gandhi joined the Indian National Congress and was introduced to
            Indian issues, politics and the Indian people primarily by Gokhale.
            Gokhale was a key leader of the Congress Party best known for his
            restraint and moderation, and his insistence on working inside the
            system. Gandhi took Gokhale's liberal approach based on British
            Whiggish traditions and transformed it to make it look Indian.
            <br /><br />
            Gandhi took leadership of the Congress in 1920 and began escalating
            demands until on 26 January 1930 the Indian National Congress
            declared the independence of India. The British did not recognise
            the declaration, but negotiations ensued, with the Congress taking a
            role in provincial government in the late 1930s. Gandhi and the
            Congress withdrew their support of the Raj when the Viceroy declared
            war on Germany in September 1939 without consultation. Tensions
            escalated until Gandhi demanded immediate independence in 1942, and
            the British responded by imprisoning him and tens of thousands of
            Congress leaders. Meanwhile, the Muslim League did co-operate with
            Britain and moved, against Gandhi's strong opposition, to demands
            for a totally separate Muslim state of Pakistan. In August 1947, the
            British partitioned the land with India and Pakistan each achieving
            independence on terms that Gandhi disapproved.
